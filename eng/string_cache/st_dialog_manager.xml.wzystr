	<text>There's Creek on the place where the cooking under water emerged. Call it the 'boiler' because there steam from the ground hit. If you think that the steam - this is nonsense, then you are deeply mistaken. Seasoned stalkers say that so that's an anomaly steam beats not weaker, and even stronger than conventional cooking. Temperature, maybe a little, and lower, but bakes longer. A common artifacts found there - fire.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_11">
	<text>They say a good place in his career: a lot of artifacts, but also a lot of anomalies. There at the bottom of gazirovok already bubbling, even in a gas mask eye cuts.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_12">
	<text>Ashes - old cemetery, near Kopacz. It is very dangerous, many cooking operations, sometimes zombies come. Typically, this place is avoided, but sometimes there are artifacts.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_13">
	<text>They say in the old parking lot artifacts found. Transport there nothing at all, but from what is, background radiation well - they already counter rolls over. Well, and in addition, there fully electric.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_14">
	<text>In 'Rotten grove', where the trees from acid twisted. Who went there, told me that there are many gazirovok, and in the air as much gas can be seen that even bad. But if the experience is, there artifacts can be found.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_15">
	<text>If you look for artifacts, it is better to acid. And the best place to look for them - a 'concrete bathtub. ' Competitors there a little: it's not like the place, due to the fact that a number of plant 'Jupiter'.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_16">
	<text>Not far from the plant 'Jupiter' failed road. This place is called 'Asphalt', because that's where the pavement poplavilos. In full break anomalies - cooking mixed with gravitational anomalies ... And just two kinds of means and artifacts must be different.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_17">
	<text>Is there creek for a cement factory, this place is also called 'Plavni'. In the place of the bay turned into a horrible stinking swamp, full of gazirovok in water. Although there are already some water, almost solid acid. Artifacts found there, but they say that this place is really like monsters.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_18">
	<text>In the old cement plant must be sought. It's full of anomalies, but it's worth it. Of course, there are places where the artifact to get easier, but where it is easier - and there is more competition. And here you just can interfere jerboa, and then, if the cellars polezesh.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_19">
	<text>Near 'Sosnoduba' must be sought. This is the same thing, which is between the hills of soda increased. Its everything is so called: some wise guy has determined that the bark on the tree partially sones, and partly - oak. If you want to search for an artifact there, you need a good protection against chemicals ... So grab more ammo out there on the hills of the dogs meet.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_2">
	<text>Sometimes it is not necessarily anomalies climb to find the artifact. I told the story of how an artifact in the middle of the field found the net. One stalker detector junk, he decided to change his akkamulyatory. Changed, and suddenly, the detector is triggered and he, almost in hand, the artifact flies. Count how lucky. Area it is this: there will punish, and there is also gifted.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_20">
	<text>By experienced stalkers heard that sometimes artifacts move outside of anomalies. Sometimes begin pikat detector, you only get one of his, but already there is nothing. This was wandering past the artifact. Chase them useless - Zone decides who to award such a miracle.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_21">
	<text>In Pripyat artifacts still no one was looking. Everyone I know here recently - cautious.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_22">
	<text>Who knows where to look for them here ... Pripyat a little explored.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_23">
	<text>I have searched in underground tunnels, they say, their lot under the city.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_24">
	<text>About these places, little is known mainly that Garik said. Says there is a place where acid from grapes grown anomalies hefty size of a ten-storey house. Maybe stretching the truth, but if not, I would have the grapes in the presence of artifacts checked.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_3">
	<text>The most sure thing - a poisonous swamp look. There's gravity anomalies complete, but they are easy to detect. They are on the water such traces are left will not go wrong. But soda is worse because of them there to breathe almost nothing, and if you falls upon, too, will not find it, corrodes armor cleaner sulfuric acid.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_5">
	<text>In the burned farm, on a hill, a lot of cooking operations, there are often artifacts, fire, natural. Must be sought in the houses, they say - which house more cooking operations after the release was formed, and that the artifact is.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_6">
	<text>In the caves under the burnt farmstead them, probably a lot ... If you go up the hill to the detector in hand - it beeps all the time. Getting there is easy - you can top, jump through the rift. Will be more difficult to get out - there are many anomalies ... Very much ... Basically, 'funnel' and 'soda' ... Even in the fault have seen that there is something moving - kind of like a 'comet'. Such is the set of different color, but also artifacts there's probably different ...</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_7">
	<text>Anomaly 'Circus' see? There's a hefty anomaly-trampoline, and around two comets circling - hurt my sight. But look better from a distance, there exists hell, in the center of cooking with a lot. Artifacts there, but look for them prevents fire poltergeist, such a bastard, but you approach, he immediately tries to fry you.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_anomalies_9">
	<text>If you are interested in gravitational artifacts, it is necessary to anomalies 'Fang' look. This place is not difficult to notice, there are anomalies strongly pokorezhilo land, part of the hill just demolished. And in caves in the hill opened, immediately snorkov settled, but they rarely go out.</text>

	<text>Brother and heard about Oasis? They say there is such a place: and it is not easy to find, let alone get if found - even harder. They also say if there is a lake: Will you come to him, and all diseases will be ... Why, all wounds are closed! Oh, that chatter .. saw how inexperienced stalkers come here, to the center of the Zone? Who is looking for artifact artifacts who - out of curiosity, but many just looking for Oasis. He's rumored to be somewhere in these parts ...</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_14">
	<text>They say everything kapets Zone has come ... Someone found the Oasis and took the artifact - 'Heart oasis'.

<string id="dm_information_15">
	<text>Poplars heard about? He his boys recently found a new ass, which, naturally, they are happy to have got. Well dolazilis before they walked the supervisor on the brain.

	<text>Kopachi heard about the village? When was the first accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, as its radiation covered, they decided to bury the whole village. Of houses in the village now only radioactive mounds remained. They say the place was awful back then, and that there is now going on - no one really knows. This place is all side passes, fear ...

	<text>Do you know that now 'Midsummer' only two stalker who approach ejection feeling quite. One - a chiropractor, our medic, and the second - Zulu, former dolgovets. The former he was recently ... When the station 'Midsummer' come 'dolgovtsev'? already there were soldiers 'Freedom'. Naturally, the arrival of 'long' they do not miss ... During the shooting half of both groups were killed, and a few more free stalkers hooked. It was then, Zulu and said that approaching the release. Had nowhere to go 'long' with 'Freedom' called a truce and took refuge in the station 'Midsummer'. A Zulu then left the 'long' and settled near the station, on the tower.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_18">
	<text>So many things strange tell ... Everything you will not believe. Services that area - storytellers divorced like dogs nestrelyanyh. But something strange happens, several stalkers from the station 'Midsummer' told that the UFO seen. It is said looked like a black disk with a diameter of five meters. While others say that remotely looks like a plane, they say, first and thought. But just the fact that among the witnesses was a former pilot - so he says that his whole life is nothing like never seen before.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_2">
	<text>From the new - just sad. Good stalkers disappear one by one, and then their bodies are, without a drop of blood. pack Lyadsky bloodsuckers, for sure! Oh, to find a hole in which they are holed up and lead them bitches to probe the most! And what's left to go to the toilet in pairs? So much for the lone stalkers ...</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_20">
	<text>There is a fresh joke. The guys from 'Liberty' got hold of the legendary founder of the PDA 'long'. So you know what? It turns out that he tricked persuaded his men that command threw them into the Zone, and on this topic amassed current group! Yes, only in Zone meanness does not pass - this beauty soon hit the spatial bubble meet. That's ... I'm still thinking in the 'long' to go; ha, now let me not march.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_21">
	<text>New unit 'long' ... There were - like from the air. He thought: group 'dolgovtsev' goes with 'Midsummer', and in return they have almost three times as much. Are they cloned?

</string>
<string id="dm_information_24">
	<text>You know stalkersky three Mityaya, Torba and Bear? They, I heard on the work the scientists settled, measurements carried out.

Do not worry, guys - break through, and there, staring, and pass the official himself vybyut.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_25">
	<text>Heard about Spartacus and his boys? They are now on the 'Skadovsk' you will not see - the bunker guarding the scientists. And that, as with the mutants cope - the guys know, and not just from the bandits fought. The point is worth - science needed rest.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_26">
	<text>May have seen mercenaries who have shops substation stuck? All do not have them there. Rumor has it - to 'Jupiter' left, guard bunker scientists. Before them, like, too mercenaries were armed, but there is something wrong with them. In principle, a good trend - some disappear, others go to their place ... Two or three times, and the mercenaries at the end Creek.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_27">
	<text>According to eyewitnesses, the bunker scientists now under the protection of the valiant fighters 'long' ... I wonder what they gain from that? Really hope that scientists in gratitude plasma gun invent, tushkanov drive? Oh my, these zaschitnichki ...</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_28">
	<text>They say that the bunker scientists now Liberty protects ... Interestingly, scientists do not fear that their research specimens can simply by smoking? Although here and use is - someone who wants to attack the bunker first have to find it in the smoke screen ... Even I myself will not be lost.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_29">
	<text>Seen 'Jupiter'? Which factory radios? Eerie place. Fuck knows what is going on - and anomalies are the same, and no more mutants than anywhere ... only still there do not want to climb. My gut - lousy places there.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_3">
	<text>Listen, this is the guy you that the physician on 'Skadovsk' to clean water brought? That's what you - thank you. And then, you see, and I have it on the table would be ... because all sinned in the mutants, but it turned out - the man is worse than the mutant. That's really true - 'man to man - the wolf. '</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_30">
	<text>So you have to ask is, what's new. After your hike in the tunnels under the 'Jupiter' then went a rumor that you got to the center of the Zone. Such a stir ... It was about ten breaks follow you go. Only Nitrogen all disappointed, says - the gateway to the tunnels were closed, and now he has them in any open can not. Of course, there were the desperate head who wanted to blow up the door, but so far they have not figured out where to get so much dynamite, and what they will breathe when down later.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_31">
	<text>Oh, Garik heard about? The stalker that scientists worked. It now 'unaccounted face' can not call it an official permit to the Zone got here, so it is! There would have to pick up the loot, but leave the zone, and he took it and went to Pripyat. Thought everything had disappeared, like the others, but no, still passed. Well, the truth, stalkers benefit from this little - he's met the military. He now anyway, it has a pass, and the usual stalkers to go there impossible.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_32">
	<text>Well ... 'Freedom' to 'long' at war again, some caches are not shared. They say there nemeryannom weapons was enough for three infantry divisions. I do not know which one of them as weapons stashed away, but the demolition was not weak, all the stalkers at the 'Midsummer' alarmed. Luckily, they moved to the side, and it would be like last time ... Now there 'Svoboda' duty, it is clear unlucky 'long'.</text>

<string id="dm_information_34">
	<text>This recently happened. Group of stalkers, during the study of tunnels near the 'Jupiter', stumbled on something, or rather, someone. First, they knocked out of the hands machines, and then they flew every crap. In general, what happened there, they really can not explain, but two guys they're lost.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_35">
	<text>Heard here, north of the 'Jupiter', in tunnels, some crap mutant found. St. John's wort there stalker sent to scout. It turned out that there was a den Burer. Sprsish why it was and is not?

</string>
<string id="dm_information_37">
	<text>Already heard of marsh bloodsuckers? Those that were smoothly? So, now there are none. St. John's Wort say figured out ... I do not own the truth, hired stalkers. The story, gather a group, ten people combed the swamp through and through, and everything that ran out, shot the fuck. Now there is even frogs left.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_38">
	<text>Yes, there is only began to say that chimera saw how she was immediately someone slammed. You see, is not so simple become stalkers and mutants that were previously killed tens of stalkers are now themselves in the flow going. Although it is said that it was an experienced hunter, to his credit many mutants, as we have with you for two killed mosquitoes.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_39">
	<text>I've heard some people to himself in the ranks of 'Freedom' is gaining? Was there a - Fire Chimera, all the time about his exploits wove a fable, but it turned out - a scoundrel, which is not enough. He is a fellow anomalies die cast, and he took the loot and disappeared. And then his 'exploits' surfaced - he Hunters Creek on a little chimera not fed. I used to svobodovtsev better attitude ... No, it's better to go to one than these 'friends' have.</text>
</string>
<string id="dm_information_4">
	<text>Well, on the chimera Creek flooded. Gonty group worked together with some stalker ... It's kind of like you and was, huh? Well, then you yourself can tell the story firsthand. Just say thank you - a bit quieter was no excess mutant cannibal.</text>

	<text>New - not new, but is there such - Noah. guy without any towers, answer. It was only on his barge to look - again from a single recall the landscape, and even built it almost a week, sho your guest workers.

	<text>Nothing new there, all the old ... Now all remember the old story about the center of the zone. For example, about Oasis - a place where the power is restored and the wounds heal instantly.

</string>
<string id="dm_information_47">
	<text>Say, Oasis actually found. I never thought that it exists, but against the facts do not trample. Inside there was an artifact, and now scientists are studying it. Maybe based on it will be able to make a device for rapid healing of wounds ... fighters would be useful such a thing.</text>

In general, this was the last time I did that at the Garbage saw more than a year ago. On both sides were killed guys - fear; our chuyuschy lay down, of blessed memory ... It was then that Zulu and yelled - output, they say. Well, do not leave the same people behind the door to die, even if 'dolgovtsev'? .. So now live: when calm - gryz�msya as well as output, sit together quietly, just each other not embrace. Well, from the Zulu 'long' left - lives as a hermit near 'Janov' ...</text>

<string id="dm_information_50">
