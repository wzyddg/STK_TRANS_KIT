And here is the fix went - to no avail, no there is not, and does not seem to have been. In addition, some information procured - rumors rife land. I hope it is useful to you.

	<text>Hello, young man. I am very glad that you came. We have a job for you. Its essence is as follows: we recently received information that stalkers opened the path leading to the Red Forest. At that time, we were just doing some experiments related to the psy-radiation, and therefore decided to put the two research groups and send them on a new path. But unfortunately, since the beginning of the campaign passed slishom lot of time and research groups under the guise of a hired guard and can not be undone again. All communication with the groups ended abruptly and we did not know what to do. Only now, decided to turn to you for help. Well, what do you say, you agree to help us?</text>

Then came the unexpected emissions, the four of us were under him, and the rest had to withdraw into the interior of the building inspector. It is a monolith saved us! We were left to themselves and to hear his voice. In that state, when we were a zombie, he became the lodestar for us, and we went at it. Monolith spoke to us and guide us! Next, remember the river with concrete banks seem to channel and a vast wasteland with buildings on the horizon. In a way no creature not attacked us - Monolith protected us on the way to it! Then there was a deserted city and houses many houses with broken windows. Pripyat! Suddenly, a voice broke the Monolith, and we did not know where to go next. We have found and sheltered at Monolith. They took care of us and waiting for some man with medications. And then you helped us come back to life, and the veil from the mind awake. Thank you again, brother. Thanks to you, we have found a new family and is now happy. Take our former weapons and equipment, Monolith gives us everything we need.

	<text>As far as I know, the building control room is located right behind the gas station. But close to her territory is under the total control of the Renegades. Himself to you there is nothing to do, too dangerous. Who better to stay with us, so better chance of survival. Okay, let's get to the point. As long as you helped my guys, I have gathered a detachment of our most experienced fighters. The purpose of the order - the seizure of the plant controlled by the renegades. To get closer to the plant, it will be necessary to cross the bridge. But then as an evil, Snork not miss - they are a whole multitude, just did a hotbed of creatures. Addressing charge you, deal with the creatures, or drive them. Once on the right, go back. At the main gate you will expect our brave soldiers. Well, good luck then!</text>
