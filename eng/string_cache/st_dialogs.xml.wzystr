</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_152">
	<text>Just about anyone, buddy. Think about it: his own faction will bury the cocksucker alive, other factions will kick up a fuss, but Owl at Zaton would make that PDA disappear real good. Only thing is, only Owl knows where that PDA will turn up later on... It's up to you.</text>

	<text>Well, with the right tools even I could do it, but then who drags equipment into the Zone with them? Visit the technicians, buddy - they're good at that kind of thing.</text>

	<text>Pripyat ain't no place for guys like us. Think about it, it's full of mutants and anomalies... like the rest of the Zone... but without stalkers and their loot. When stalkers show up in Pripyat, give us a shout and we'll head on over there to maintain the natural order of things.</text>

	<text>You hear anything about the Oasis?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_111">
	<text>It's a stalker fairytale. That's what stalkers do: make up shit that ain't true and then all get together and search for it! I'd ignore that stuff if I were you. It's like a gateway myth: believe it and you'll believe that the Wish Granter exists before long.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_112">
	<text>Ah, that place where wounds heal by themselves and your energy is magically replenished? I got news for you, friend: it don't exist. Stalkers invent that crap to make the Zone sound less dangerous than it is, but the harsh reality is that there are no safe places in the Zone. And you gotta keep a firm grasp on that reality out here, buddy - dreamer types don't last long in the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_113">

</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_22">
	<text>Yeah, our scouts saw a military helicopter descend towards the reserve pads by Jupiter. They said they kept signaling them to change course but I guess the pilots had other things to worry about. I wonder if the army boys managed to get out of the mine field OK.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_23">
	<text>Not around here, no. Our presence here is limited... try asking our boys near Yanov.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_25">
	<text>Our patrol reported that a military helicopter attempted a crash landing near the Jupiter plant. Unfortunately, the chopper crashed right into the roof above the workshops. There are probably no survivors - the patrol didn't receive any distress signals after the crash.</text>

<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_3">

<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_301">
	<text>Someone who has some use for them. I'm talking about Pilot - he's a guide on the route between Yanov and Skadovsk, so he'd find those maps useful, that's for sure.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_31">
	<text>Military? I've not seen any around here, but we don't spend much time in this area.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_35">
	<text>A soldier's corpse was spotted in the mine field recently. He's probably one of the fellas that flew in in that chopper. The chopper carries up to eight people in addition to the crew, so they must have found a way out, though nobody knows where they went.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_36">
	<text>A military fella was seen at the scientists' bunker and he only got there recently. I don't know the details.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_37">
	<text>Some guy in military uniform was seen entering a building by the Volkhov AA complex the other day. It's quite possible that it was just a zombie mistaken for a soldier though.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_38">
	<text>Stalkers spotted a military unit near Jupiter plant. Judging by the description it was special forces. They were accompanied by an unidentified stalker and headed towards Pripyat. This sounds reliable, but experience shows that information like that usually can't be trusted.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_4">
	<text>Do you know how to get to Pripyat?</text>

</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_401">
	<text>They won't find better protection than Duty will provide. Go see Lieutenant Colonel Shulga at Yanov - I'm sure the two of you will work something out.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_402">
	<text>Nah. While they've got Freedom people working for them, we'll stay well away from that place. Listening to those idiots crack their shitty jokes all day long is a fate worse than death.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_42">
	<text>Duty has no reason to look for a way to Pripyat at the moment, but we're collecting information anyway. There are unconfirmed reports that tunnels under the Jupiter plant lead to Pripyat. Checking this information would require searching everything in the plant area thoroughly.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_43">
	<text>No. If you need that kind of information you'll have to speak to a civilian guide - our scouts have enough on their plates as it is.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_44">
	<text>Our scouts regularly check the area for safe paths to Pripyat, but that hasn't yielded any results as yet.</text>

	<text>Duty's presence in this area is limited. Speak to our people at Yanov.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_52">
	<text>There's a rumor that the scientists have a military guy in their bunker. He hasn't got much of a way out, though. You see, the scientists are there for twelve to eighteen months and he's not going to get to the edge of the Zone on foot and on his own. Considering that, I bet he'd be interested.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_53">
	<text>I would be looking for your place among those who are his own adventure ... uh-uh, my head is. Get out at the station 'Midsummer' is a stalker Vano.

<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_54">
	<text>Well, no, you can certainly call for volunteers in the nuthouse ... Stop! I know who you will approach - 'Monolith'! There is just near the SAM noticed squad. You're just that ... a soldier's sense of humor do not take seriously, okay?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_56">
	<text>Look for volunteers in Duty. Strider, for example. He hasn't got a mission yet, so I figure the Lieutenant Colonel might let him go with you.</text>

	<text>That's a dumb question - Duty, of course. We've got lots of folks with experience and we've worked with the scientists before. Go see Lieutenant Colonel Shulga - I'm sure he'll find a squad for the job.</text>

	<text>I found a very strange artifact. Can you suggest a buyer?</text>

	<text>I found a whole bloodsucker lair nearby. What are we gonna do?</text>

<string id="about_quests_dialog_dolg_91">
	<text>Duty squads are not currently engaging in purging operations in this area, so the lair will have to wait.</text>

</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_11">
	<text>You hear anything about the Oasis?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_111">
	<text>Bulk. Hmm, really, really beautiful legend. Palace of the endless sands of the island in the ocean mist, the castle with towers up to the sky ... Shambhala, Eden ... Oasis. And then - is there a free man without a dream?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_112">
	<text>Out of interest - the story of a stalker. It seems to me, first spoke about Oasis. They say there is a minute delayed wound, and the soul is calm and quiet, and if you were not in the middle of the Zone with all its charms. Hmm ... by the way, I am of the Maine since then and have not seen. And scratched me more then anything, and that - only then understood. He's always limp, and then from our campfire so cheerfully uprygal like fifteen dropped.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_113">
	<text>Yes, free stalkers gave me the coordinates... Ten different sets of coordinates. Putting them together gives us an area from the Scorcher to the CNPP with the Yanov bar somewhere near the center. It's entirely possible that we're in the Oasis right now, so enjoy it!</text>

<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_141">
	<text>I heard that Nitro at Yanov is a fan of combinations and algorithms. I'm not sure though, I've never really spoken to him - he's working for Duty, so he ain't got much time for us free folk.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_143">
	<text>I'm not much of an expert on local experts... Ask our boys over at Yanov next time you're there - they'll know for sure.</text>

<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_163">
	<text>Of course, about the plant, man. But listen, there's dumb ... well, count as if the subway with pakavanom to open shove ... You feel, huh? There are, however, a positive moment warehouses. In warehouses is not stremaet - this time, and the two - there are an order of magnitude greater than any catches nishtyakov type your tools. And yet, in the territory of pozyray SAM, there seem garage is ...</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_165">
	<text>That's a good question, man. Let's think about this one. Where do you find tools outside the Zone? Now, if you got half a brain, you buy them in a store... If you don't, you look for the tools and a brain in a workshop. Right? It's the same thing in the Zone - you have to look in the same places. It's that simple, stalker!</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_166">
	<text>Tools? Listen, man, you is not encrypted, you normally ask. There is no pressure Babylon, encrypted, do not ... No, you're really serious about the tools? Listen, I do not even know ...</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_169">
	<text>I've heard is, yes, heard ... One guy once in the case of the complex ventilation got that aboutf/A. And there 'Zombarevichi' sting!

	<text>Who can unblock a memory module?</text>

<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_171">
	<text>Well, Novikov in the scientists' bunker can do it. He's fast, good and polite. There's also Nitro at Yanov, the Duty hanger-on. He's cheap and shitty, but he'll probably do the job.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_172">
	<text>Perhaps some clever techniques. Local, I heard more in the locksmith parts. So to you, if the memory module is not necessary to cut the thread, go near 'Jupiter' ask: where the technicians situevina better.</text>

<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_18">
	<text>Who could break into a steel container?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_181">
	<text>Well, Cardan at Skadovsk is supposed to be good. People say he knows what he's doing, even though he's drunk most of the time. He might be able to help you crack that container.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_182">
	<text>Anyone who breaks into steel containers for a living? Nitro the local technician won't do, though. I hear he's more into breaking into other people's electronics.</text>

	<text>Man, you definitely need Loki. That we have a cheerleader in these parts, to 'Midsummer' lives. Quickly drag the Old to it, that's straight Wait a drag! You do not know, 'dolgovtsev' about her not got wind? Immediately Well the main thing that 'dolgovtsev' is not got wind. Otherwise ... no, well, you just count up, what a bunch of crap they are beautiful joy then all ears in bulk? Heck I even think about such a sickening!</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_22">
	<text>Yup. Heard about turntables in a minefield? There once was a backup area, here fighters on it and flopped. And the fact that it is theirs for five years ... or six? .. Well, in short, once there themselves warriors and mined. On the other hand, something seems to me that's not for nothing they had done so. Mined that no one climb, yeah? And this here is that on the turntable, in fact, quietly sat in a cleared area, now scroll through your business, and then come back, sit in your crew will launch the screws - and hello! Oh, to know what their problem - maybe would have intercepted?</text>

<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_23">

<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_25">
	<text>Yes, our guys have seen one such recently. Flew like the hedgehog proud after kick ... and landed respectively - slammed on the abdomen.

</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_31">
	<text>Chill, dude. There ain't no cops, no jarheads and no friggin' militia around here - you're as safe as can be in the Zone.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_35">
	<text>No, but some fellas told me they saw an army unit crawling through the mine field by the helipads. Those fellas thought about helping them but decided against it. The jarheads are an unpredictable breed, you never know when they'll snap and shoot you in the back.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_36">
	<text>I do not see, but people said: the scientific bunker nailed soldier. Ozersky - a biologist at them - dropped as something that soldier with the turntables, which drove into the plant. Our fun watching now: behold, they say, well done guys have got a pet - a scientist soldier.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_37">
	<text>Not personally, but I heard some things from free stalkers. They said that a jarhead was spotted by the Volkhov AA complex. Gotta be a ghost or a zombie that's woken up... what do you reckon?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_38">
	<text>Nope. But one meng said, seen near the radio factory already seven military: are currently in single file for some stalker in the direction of Pripyat. I think so: Gasha we have not imported, so this is a shameless rut and fiction, or ... uh-uh ... yeah, shiz.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_4">
	<text>Do you know how to get to Pripyat?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_40">
	<text>Who could I hire to protect the scientists?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_401">
	<text>Freedom, us in other words. We work with the scientists all the time, so guarding them would be piece of cake for us. Talk to our boss Loki over at Yanov - he'll agree for sure.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_402">
	<text>I ain't sure, friend, 'cause from what I've been hearing the eggheads hired a Duty squad to work for them... We'd love to guard the scientists, but staring at those constipated Duty faces every day just ain't worth it.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_42">
	<text>It is said to 'Jupiter' is the way. In a sense, from the factory. Not with the fact that the asteroids, no. Hy-s ... That's what I rotted-al!</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_43">
	<text>You know, I ain't got a clue. Just can't find the time to go there... I'd ask Pilot in the camp, yeah? He's a free stalker and knows the area better than anyone.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_44">
	<text>Bro, if I knew I'd have gone there a long time ago. Getting away from Duty, the jarheads and all this fighting would be worth it...</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_5">
	<text>Can you suggest anyone that's not too tied down who'd be willing to make a move for Pripyat?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_51">
	<text>Sorry, buddy, I did on the Creek is not particularly know. All I can advise: posproshay on 'Midsummer' our of People.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_52">
	<text>You know the scientists' bunker? Well, they've got a situation on their hands over there. First Garry, the stalker, decided to make for Pripyat and now the jarhead who's there got the same idea. Garry is a loner and proud of it, but that jarhead is exactly what you're looking for.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_53">
	<text>Yes, even on the same Vano 'Midsummer'. Normal dude, we have long to yourself ... with open arms ... but he does not want. No buzz with his 'Duty' like a dog - he does with anybody does not like Fang. Here's a guy in a vital position.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_54">
	<text>Sure thing. One of our guys spotted a squad by the dry lake. They're bound to know Pripyat like the back of their hands and they don't seem to be working for anyone. They're sure to be brave, too, 'cause they're Monolith fighters!</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_55">
	<text>Yeah. Strider, the leader of our new recruits... it seems he feels uneasy in our ranks. His boys have adapted just fine but he's not all that happy here... Speak to him - I hate to see a good man being where his heart don't lie...</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_57">
	<text>Nah, no clue.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_6">
	<text>I found an unusual shooter. Do you know anyone who might know something about it?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_62">
	<text>Instructions to it, by chance, is not it? Well, no idea.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_7">
	<text>Who could I hire to take measurements for the scientists?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_71">
	<text>I reckon our boys could do the job. Freedom has its share of smart folks and if we don't know something we'll ask at the bunker. We'd love the opportunity to help science! Speak to Loki at Yanov - I'm sure he'll say the same.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_72">
	<text>We would be happy to work smart dudes, but they now have protection from the 'long' score. Now to the eggheads look - I think anyway that bronelobyh deliberately run up, well, every day there is flickering ... no, well, its bounce. Good in this situevine here do not wait.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_8">
	<text>I found a very strange artifact. Can you suggest a buyer?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_81">
	<text>You need a collector, buddy. You won't find one at Yanov , seeing as even some stalkers are afraid of coming here. You'd best ask at Zaton, it's a bit quieter in those parts.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_83">
	<text>You know Beard, the barman in the free stalker camp? He buys up artifacts and don't rip you off too much either. A nice fella, whichever way you look at it. It's a pity he don't work for us, really.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_9">
	<text>I found a whole bloodsucker lair nearby. What are we gonna do?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_91">
	<text>Here, dude, an urgent need to merge these data free stalkers: here they like it or not, the main camp. No, wildlife zones - it valuable, unique biocenosis and all that, but I somehow human muzzle nicer, even if respirators.</text>

<string id="about_quests_dialog_freedom_98">

</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_112">
	<text>Well, they say that wounds heal instantly there and your energy is replenished in minutes... They say no disease or sickness can last in the Oasis, not even radiation poisoning! The one thing I know for sure, though, is its whereabouts... Wanna know? It's in the center of the Zone! But you gotta keep this between us, not a word to anyone!</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_113">
	<text>I've heard, there you can find any thing down the colony - and none will attack on you, can you imagine? And they say there artifact is - Heart of the Oasis. It is because of him everything is so, and no one can take it. Who will raise, that will no longer be living - in the Zone, anywhere ... like this. Where Oasis ask? Ugh, eccentric man, everyone knows it Well! On Pripyat Ferris Wheel at where else would?</text>

<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_162">

	<text>I heard on the Pripyat has a couple of places where you can find various technical crap. And like one of them - a river port. You specifics of such places in the days catch?

</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_165">

<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_166">
	<text>To be honest, the last place I saw decent tools was in Sidorovich's bunker at the Cordon. Sure, you have to pay for them, but they're new and not all that expensive either.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_167">
	<text>You know, buddy, I didn't come to the Zone to search for tools. Think about it, how much use is a radioactive hammer?</text>

<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_168">
	<text>Someone once said that the port area, you can get hold of any small things, if something better in mind not. Well, there is and tools can be found, why not? Who is there and back will break first, and sneakers, he and everyone else will tell.</text>

</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_172">
	<text>Well, you'll need a technician, but the only one around here is Cardan. Thing is, after that many years at the bottom of a bottle, he's not exactly safe around complex electronics. I'd ask around at Jupiter if I were you - they've got the right experts there.</text>

	<text>I've heard that a few pieces of helicopters here somewhere crashed. Where exactly - it say different, I just only about one to remember. It seems he sat down on some back ground that the military themselves before mined. Count up, huh? In true say: do not spit into the well.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_23">
	<text>A buddy of mine told me this story... He went to the Iron Forest to get some artifacts and as soon as he got there he heard this crash behind him. He turned to see what it was and saw a chopper coming towards him at full speed, taking down pylons and shit on its way. He bolted the hell outta there... I'm surprised he made it out without landing in an anomaly. You won't have much trouble finding the Iron Forest - you can see it from miles off. It's full of friggin' poltergeists, too, so keep your wits about ya.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_24">
	<text>I heard one landed on the southern plateau but getting up there ain't easy. The other thing I heard is that someone spotted Noah on the edge of that plateau, which means that psycho knows a way of getting to it.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_25">
	<text>I've not seen any myself but rumor has it that one crashed right into the plant... Nobody wants to check it out though - the place is just too dangerous.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_26">
	<text>One stalker told me he saw several military helis getting into some trouble... He saw the engine on one light up and then it went straight down into a swamp full of anomalies. You'll be able to get there easy enough, but the swamp itself is a friggin' nightmare... It's no place for humans, believe you me.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_3">
	<text>You seen any military around?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_30">
	<text>Who could be interested in maps of the area between Zaton and Jupiter?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_301">
	<text>Pilot, who the hell else? He's a guide, you know? Constantly making trips between Skadovsk and Yanov, so he'll find a use for your maps sure enough.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_302">
	<text>This ain't Zaton or Jupiter, so these maps are useless here, right? Ask around in those places and you might have more luck!</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_31">
	<text>See - not seen, but heard a bike. Say warriors descended from the southern plateau by dermootstoynika. Where did they come from there, no one knows. It seems like at first tried everything to make science, on the ropes down and then spat - and straight down on my ass moved out. Bobsleigh, well!</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_32">
	<text>On 'Skadovsk' chatted as if seen from the heels of the military. They came out of the drainage tunnel that near the swamp. Say were dirty as hell and one in general, as marsh bloodsucker - in the mud up to their eyebrows.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_33">
	<text>Not personally, but a friend of mine saw a military unit engage a group of mercs by the processing station. But by the time he found a nice spot to enjoy the show it was over 'cause the jarheads fell back. No casualties on either side either... typical, ain't it?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_34">
	<text>Apparently ten or so jarheads were spotted hanging around Noah's barge. Now, given that the psycho was alive at this point, he probably came to some sort of agreement with them... which is just like him. Obviously nobody wanted to ask Noah about what happened - you never know what to expect from that crazy son of a bitch.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_35">
	<text>I heard something explode at night and then someone at Yanov told me that they saw a dead jarhead in the old mine field and an abandoned army chopper behind him. Seems they couldn't tell where they landed in the dark and went straight across the mines. Nobody knows how many of them made it out of there, but I doubt he flew that chopper in on his own.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_36">
	<text>I've not really seen any military... but I've heard rumors that a jarhead is hanging around with the scientists. The story goes that Garry, a stalker, found him when he went into the missile complex to look for his buddies. Now, the complex is crawling with zombies who aren't exactly friendly to stray humans, so Garry basically saved him from certain death.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_37">
	<text>No, but I heard that a jarhead was spotted by the Volkhov AA complex. I don't really believe it though... They could be lying or maybe they just can't tell a zombie from a soldier.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_38">
	<text>Military? Well, I heard people saying that "a whole military unit lead by a stalker" was making its way past the Jupiter plant, but I didn't pay much attention to that gossip.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_4">
	<text>Do you know how to get to Pripyat?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_40">
	<text>Who could I hire to protect the scientists?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_401">
	<text>You know Spartacus and his squad? You know, the stalkers at Zaton? They're good people and decent fighters - they've been there, done that and got the T-shirt. I have a feeling they'd like the idea of guarding the scientists.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_402">
	<text>Did you run into Hatchet's squad by the substation workshops at Zaton? They've got their problems, like all mercs, but at least they ask questions first and shoot later. I'm guessing if you manage to sign them up for this job, the scientists will be pleased and stalkers can relax a little, too. Everyone's happy, right?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_403">
	<text>Erm... Nothing comes to mind... No, sorry.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_41">
	<text>That's what I do know is that there is no way Creek. Everyone who Pripyat unbearable, went towards 'Jupiter' in those places and ask.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_42">
	<text>Well, rumor has it that there are secret tunnels to Pripyat underneath the Jupiter plant... The thing is, these rumors usually get told after the second round, and then Jupiter is such a friggin' nightmare that nobody dares goes near it.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_43">
	<text>How should I know, dude? You got any easier questions for me? All I can say is that you should find Pilot and talk to him - if anyone can help you, it's him.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_44">
	<text>X-heh! If I knew how to get to Pripyat, I used here was not. And with what joy do you think I do pinned to the center of the Zone? There, in the Pripyat artifacts - the darkness! Who gets the first - and the godfather to the king!</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_5">
	<text>Can you suggest anyone that's not too tied down who'd be willing to make a move for Pripyat?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_51">
	<text>I don't think there's anyone like that around here. Everyone who wanted to be closer to the center of the Zone left for Jupiter. That's where I'd ask if I were you.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_52">
	<text>You heard about the jarhead who's with the scientists at the moment? I reckon he ain't got much to lose by going with you. The scientists are not leaving any time soon, he can't reach the Cordon on his own, so he just might be dumb enough to go to Pripyat with you!</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_53">
	<text>You know Vano Station 'Midsummer'? Honest guy and a great stalker ... just trusting - horror! Here is someone who, it must be exactly there where anomalies more and less people. Zona his loves and saves, and there is always a bastard, ready to cheat.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_54">
	<text>In general, listen, man. Say, to the south of SAM, near the Doctor. lake, seen a group of fighters. And they say, it's not just any there stalkers or 'Freedom' to 'long', and the most that neither is the Monolith! Think about it. And I say this: if you want people to march on the Pripyat, so you'd better not find ... Gee-s, man! What, was led? Well I banter! With 'Monolith' thing to have ... you what.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_55">
	<text>Maybe heard of Rolling Stone? Saw his sour face? In general, there is such a commander, a new unit 'Svoboda' leads. Blind man can see: itching on his 'Midsummer' somehow, oh itching ... You would have tried to talk to him. You look, and he agrees.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_56">
	<text>Maybe you know a tramp, a new squad leader 'dolgovtsev'? Saw his sour face? Hedgehog clearly itching to do it on the 'Midsummer' oh itching. You would have it ... tried to talk to him. You look, and he agrees.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_57">
	<text>Hrm... Nobody comes to mind.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_6">
	<text>I found an unusual shooter. Do you know anyone who might know something about it?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_62">
	<text>Fuck knows. I would specialists asked around ... maybe won, they know the art.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_63">
	<text>Did you ask for Cardan 'Skadovsk' - definitely will not be worse. All the same gunsmith - golden hands ... Yes, talent is not exactly spend on drink.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_7">
	<text>Who could I hire to take measurements for the scientists?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_71">
	<text>You know Gonta the hunter? I'm thinking he and his boys wouldn't object to working for the scientists. I mean, if mutants become a nuisance, those boys are exactly what you need to deal with them.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_72">
	<text>You heard of Grizzly, Torba and Mitay, the stalkers at Yanov? They work as a trio and they're shit hot! I think they're right for that kind of work... as long as Mitay has managed to stay out of trouble for once.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_73">
	<text>No clue, fella. We got enough of our own shit to worry about here.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_8">
	<text>I found a very strange artifact. Can you suggest a buyer?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_81">
	<text>Don't think so. People around here go for the familiar. Ask around Zaton, it's closer to the edge of the Zone and all that.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_83">
	<text>I'd show it to Beard, the barman at Skadovsk. They say he works with collectors from the outside world and those cats always go nuts for strange stuff.</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_9">
	<text>I found a whole bloodsucker lair nearby. What are we gonna do?</text>
</string>
<string id="about_quests_dialog_stalkers_91">
	<text>Wow, you gotta tell Beard at Skadovsk about that... 'cause either we deal with them or they'll tear us a new one.</text>

<string id="about_quests_dialog_bandit_27">
	<text>Syshish, well, what the fuck, helicopters? Well, those with two bubbles are - yes, the harsh truth of life. And those who fly in the sky, it's there for us like this ... Goethe, oh! High poetry, understand?</text>
