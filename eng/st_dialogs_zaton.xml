	<text>Virtually all have enemies in the Zone, Major. But I do not think that someone decided to pay with Homs, when he was with a group of stalkers ... It would be easier to deal with him face to face, not with them.</text>

	<text>It is worth remembering that the anomalies are often near or very hot, or the air is full of toxic gases, or simply a high background radiation. I guess I will not mention Psi breakdown.

	<text>They are typically stationary. When you look at a particular spot and notice that objects are distorted behind it - you've got one. And you better keep your distance. All three known varieties react instantly, the moment something touches them. Springboard hurls everything from under it - often at a great distance. Vortex does the opposite: it sucks an object in, crushes it with terrible pressure, only to send the bits flying seconds after. Whirligig lifts its victim in the air, spins and tears him to shreds... An unpleasant end, whichever way you go.</text>

The second - something that can be described in words 'fireball'. Of course, the ball, and, of course, an electrical nature ... Both anomalies are actively move, but as a rule - for closed trajectories. Attentive stalker can easily pass them. The main thing - do not be distracted.</text>
